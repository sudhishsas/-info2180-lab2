            <p>This is my first blog. This is the first blog paragraph. I know how to 
                program in java and python. You may need to make your paragraphs a bit
                longer in order to properly see the effect of the text wrapping around
                the image. Also don’t make your images too big. You can set the height
                and width attributes on the image tag to make them smaller. The new series 
                Squid game on Netflix is a really interesting show. The show looks at a 
                koreans that are in dept, in dier need of money. They are told about a game 
                that could save there lives with a catch.

                This is the second paragraph to my first blog WICKED.According to Guinness World Records,
                the first person to be charged with speeding was Walter Arnold of the English village of 
                Paddock Wood, Kent. Food waste is a huge problem. How big? About 931 million metric tons.
                That's how much food that researchers with the United Nations estimate was wasted in 2019, 
                according to the Food Waste Index Report 2021, which surveyed 54 countries, finding that the
                majority of wasted food (61%) comes from homes while restaurants and other food services produce
                26% of wasted food. Grocery stores make up just 13% of food waste.

            This is the first paragraph to my second blog. Hang on to your hats because this isn't your average 
            wind storm. In 1996, a tropical cyclone named Olivia hit off the coast of Barrow Island, Australia 
            with such a force that it broke an incredible record. According to The Weather Channel, "Olivia's 
            eyewall produced five extreme three-second wind gusts, the peak of which was a 253 mph gust," which 
            blew past the previous wind record of 231 mph set in Mount Washington, New Hampshire back in 1934.

            This is the second paragraph to my second blog. If you're an avid rainbow gazer and want to get your 
            fill of the beautiful phenomenon, look no further than the state of Hawaii. A study published by the 
            American Meteorological Society in 2021 noted that the area's "mountains produce sharp gradients in 
            clouds and rainfall, which are key to abundant rainbow sightings." Air pollution, pollen, and a large 
            amount of cresting waves also help to put Hawaii at the top of the list when it comes to rainbow 
            quantity and quality. 
            The "weapons-grade" Dragon's Breath chili pepper is so hot it's downright deadly. If you ate one, it 
            could potentially cause a type of anaphylactic shock, burning your airways and closing them up.

            "I've tried it on the tip of my tongue and it just burned and burned," said Mike Smith, the hobby grower 
            who invented the Dragon's Breath along with scientists from Nottingham University. So why make such an 
            impractical pepper? As it turns out, the chili was initially developed to be used in medical treatment 
            as an anesthetic that can numb the skin.This is the first paragraph to my second blog. Hang on to your hats because this isn't your average
